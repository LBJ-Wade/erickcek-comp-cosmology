Upon the end of the semester, several primary missions remained:

1) Fix Rockstar's erroneous centering of the high mass halos in the STANDARD
simulations. This will then allow my density profile program to properly compare
the density profiles of simulations with and without EMDE.

2) Run convergence tests on boost factor integrals. Specifically the calculation
of J. The smooth integral is relatively converged using my integration technique.
It might be beneficial to find better ways altogether to calculate the integrals
for the top and bottom of the boost factor.

3) Write a script to run through an entire halo catalogue, pulling out the
particle data for each and calculating the boost factor. Collect the halo mass,
radius, boost factor, etc. for each. Use this data to collect a boost factor
mass function, and then ultimately calculate the box boost factor.

Ideas for boost factor/mass calculator:
Pull contents from largest_halo_data_extractor.py and put it into a loop
which will iterate across all of the halos instead of the largest one.

Have this script follow the steps outlined for calculating a boost factor,
but instead of printing to screen, store in a file. This can be parallelized,
and then the files can all be combined at the end with all the data.
