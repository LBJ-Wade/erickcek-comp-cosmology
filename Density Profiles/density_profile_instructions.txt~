1. Run largest_alo_data_extractor and it will output the locations of the particles (we still need to get particle mass somehow)
2. Run command cat *.particle > all_particles.txt
3. Run density_prof.py, which takes all the particles, bins them, and outputs a density profile file, which we can plot on a personal computer.

example:

bsub python largest_halo_data_extractor.py rockstar_halos.ascii gadg_.000030_512_dm_010.*

wait until all the jobs finish

cat *.particle > halo_1_particles.txt

python density_prof.py halo1_particles.txt halo1_params.txt
