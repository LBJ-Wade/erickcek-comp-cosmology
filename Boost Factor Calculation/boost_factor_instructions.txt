1. Run largest_halo_data_extractor and it will output the locations of the particles (we still need to get particle mass somehow)
2. Run command cat *.particle > all_particles.txt
3. Run calc_boost_factor.py, which takes all the particles, bins them, and outputs a density profile file, which we can plot on a personal computer.

example:

bsub python largest_halo_data_extractor.py rockstar_halos.ascii gadg_.000030_512_dm_010.*

wait until all the jobs finish

cat *.particle > halo_1_particles.txt

python calc_boost_factor.py halo1_particles.txt halo1_params.txt

The parameter file is generated per halo by largest_halo_data_extractor.py

WITHIN calc_boost_factor.py, there is the same routine as density_profile.py,
but with the final plotting of the boost factors commented out.

If you would like to both see the density profile and calculate the boost factor,
simply uncomment that part of the code.
