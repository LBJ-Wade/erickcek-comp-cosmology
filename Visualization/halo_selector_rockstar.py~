PROCEDURE FOR VISUALIZING MICROHALOS
1. Run this script, giving it as arguments the corresponding ROCKSTAR halo file and the associated gadget snapshot blocks
2. Using the *.vis files, run block_combine.py to combine them all into one .txt file for visualization.
3. Use flat_visualize.py and visualize.py with the .txt file to view microhalo

PROCEDURE FOR GENERATING DENSITY PROFILES
1. Run this script, same as above, and it will output the locations of the particles (we still need to get particle mass somehow)
2. Run command cat *.particle > all_particles.txt
3. Run density_prof.py, which takes all the particles, bins them, and outputs a density profile file, which we can plot on a personal computer

PROCEDURE FOR CALCULATING BOOST FACTORS:
1. Run this script, giving it as arguments the corresponding ROCKSTAR halo file and the associated gadget snapshot blocks
2. Run command cat *.particle > all_particles.txt
3. ...

#density profile:
#scan through all the halos within that radius and check location, mark which radii ring its in
#run back through and make the density profile, by summing up total in each concentric ring
