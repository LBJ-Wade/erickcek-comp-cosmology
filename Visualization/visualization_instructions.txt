1. Run largest_halo_data_extractor.py, giving it as arguments the corresponding ROCKSTAR halo file and the associated gadget snapshot blocks.
2. Using the *.vis files generated, run block_combine.py to combine them all into one .txt file for visualization.
3. Use flat_visualize.py or visualize.py with the .txt file to view microhalo

example:

bsub python largest_halo_data_extractor.py rockstar_halos.ascii gadg_.000030_512_dm_010.*

wait until all the jobs finish

bsub python block_combine.py *.vis

wait for this one (slowest one because i haven't figured out how to parallelize)

Transfer the *_final_mesh.txt file onto PERSONAL COMPUTER

python flat_visualize.py *_final_mesh.txt

OR

python visualize.py *_final_mesh.txt

You MUST have installed the mayavi python module in order to use mlab for visualization.
