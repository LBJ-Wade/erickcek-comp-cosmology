Regular Running Instructions

Copy AHFinput to the location in which you would like Amiga outputs.
Edit ic_filename to be the path to the snapshot file you would like to analyze. If there are multiple files for your snapshot, stop after the . immediately preceding the block numbers.
The ic_filetype should be set to 60 if there is only one file and to 61 if there are multiple.
The outfile_prefix should be set to your preferred naming convention. The files will take the form: <outfile_prefix>.<snapshot_redshift>.<suffix>
Halo catalogs have the suffix .AHF_halos
NminPerHalo establishes the minimum number of particles that can constitute a halo. The default for both Amiga and Rockstar is 20.
RhoVir establishes whether densities should be compared to the critical density or the background density. The default value, 0, corresponds to critical. 1 switches to background.
Dvir sets the density threshold for what is in a halo. The default is 200. Taken together with RhoVir, this means the default mass definition is M200c.
Save and exit the file.

Submit: bsub -M 50 /path/to/ModifiedAHF/bin/AHF-v1.0-084 AHFinput
Pay attention to memory consumption. 50 GB is a good starting point for 512^3 simulations, but some power spectra and box size combinations may take more or less.
For 1024^3 simulations, more memory will be required. Start with 300 GB as a reasonable guess. This will require the bigmem queue, so be sure to use: -q bigmem
