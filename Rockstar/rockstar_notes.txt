Look over RockstarRunInstructions to get the idea of how to run Rockstar.

However, instead of copying start.cfg, use the file in this directory named 'rockstar_start_template.cfg'
This file comes from Andreas, one of Adrienne's colleagues who is an expert with Rockstar.

Change the inbase, outbase, bcg2, etc. according to RockstarRunInstructions

If the run doesn't work properly, shrink the overlap length by an order of magnitude.

We have confirmed that the mass and length conversion to be correct according to gadget's internal units!
Rockstar is in units of /h, just as gadget is as well.

FORCE_RES IS VERY IMPORTANT -- SOFTENING LENGTH CALCULATOR
We need to change the FORCE_RES according to the proper softening length for our simulation
The FORCE_RES is in units of Mpc/h, defined to be 1/30th of the interparticle spacing:
FORCE_RES =  (.03 * box_size_in_Mpc/h ) / n
Where n is the particle count: ie 512, 1024...
For example:
30pc/h box, n=512, we have a FORCE_RES = 1.758e-9

Remember that the units are in Mpc/h for FORCE_RES/Softening Length
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The other big note that is important for halo cataloging is that halos of mass less
than 100 particles cannot be trusted due to numerical instability.

This puts the k_cut regime outside of our current simulation resolution.
